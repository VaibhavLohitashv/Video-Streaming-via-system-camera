This is a project based on server to client video streaming using opencv librabry.
This project is in JAVA language.
It contains a readme file, word file that is the project report, a Server java file, a Client java file and the main Streaming file that uses threads to run server and client to simulate successful connection.
You can run the project without he Streaming java file.
First Run the Server java file it will wait until a Client gets connected.
So to connect a Client, run the Client java file.
A window will pop and the streaming will start.

NOTE:  This is just a simple project and furthur development can be done.

WARNING !! : Please install OpenCV library for java and configure the dll files with the project. Without installation the rpoject will not work as it contains classes and utilitie from OpenCV.

THANK YOU
